## Project Summary:

Moonramp ticker gathers up to date data from Coinmarketcap API to update coin quotes on a set time interval. Updates an external database to be accessed by other services (moonramp-web)

## Build Info:
- Built in go 1.25.X
- Uses John Barton's [dotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)

### Services 

relies on 3 internal services: 
1. Mapper: Utilities to generate Coinmarketcap ID's map used by the Ticker service to fetch data for each coin/token. Uses DB, API call and fallback map for failsafe implementation.
2. Ticker: Fetch up to date data for every coin/token in ID map generated by mapper. Makes API call at set interval and stores data in DB. 
3. Coins: Keeps track of coins and their CMC ID's for ticker to build queries and update DB.
